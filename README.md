# Single-Trial-Learning

Single-trial-learning is supposed to test _only_ initial effects on implicit adaptation of any kind of perturbation or feedback. We test several here:

1. Is implicit adaptation attenuated for larger rotations? Or does it remain constant?
2. Does task error contribute to initial implicit adaptation? Or could there only be contributions from sensory prediction errors?
3. Does delayed feedback eliminate implicit adaptation? Or maybe it's only attenuated?

There are two experiments used in this project. The first is used to answer questions 1 and 2. This uses 3 separate conditions (data sets?), that only differ in the sizes of the perturbations presented to participants (up to 45, 60 or 90 degrees). The second uses terminal feedback and 5 delays (between 0 and 1.6 s) repeated for all of 6 rotations (up to 45 degrees).

This repo can be opened (cloned) as an R Studio project, where an R Markdown Notebook will guide you through reproducing all the pre-processing, figures, analyses and results shown in the paper (and more). Or you could just try to figure out how the code works.
